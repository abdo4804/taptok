      <p>
        TapTok is more than a brand—it's a signal. A pulse. A movement. Born from the fusion of NFC technology and cyberpunk aesthetics, TapTok empowers creators, hustlers, and rebels to connect instantly, securely, and stylishly.

        Whether you're sharing your digital identity, unlocking exclusive drops, or flexing encrypted wearables, TapTok turns every tap into a moment. Our products blend form and function—neon-lit wristbands, glitchy game tokens, and modular cyber decks built for the underground.
      </p>
